 Web App to keep track of emotions and personal growth
 
 Made with Create React App, this app has three main sections:
 
 1. About -- describes the usage, includes a quiz to help decide what parts of the app will be useful
 2. Forms -- the heart of the app, these are forms in which the user can record a variety of topics, including feelings, self-discipline, exercise, etc.
 3. Sheets -- these display the results taken from the forms, like journals over time
